                <h4>When the Morning Dawns</h4>
                <p>The French Revolution constituted for the conscience of the dominant aristocratic class a fall from innocence, and upturning of the natural chain of events that resounded all over Europe; the old regime became, in their imaginary, a paradise lost.</p>

                  <li>The Emerald Buddha</li>
                  <li>Fact And Truth</li>
                  <li>Comment On The Importance Of Human Life</li>
                  <li>Fact And Truth</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This explains why some romantic poets born in the higher classes were keen on seeing themselves as faded aristocrates, expelled from their comfortable milieu by a reverse of fortune or a design of destiny.<span class="font-weight-bold"> Byron and Shelley are the prime instances of this vital pose.</span> In The Giaour he writes on a vampiric character: "The common crowd but see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and fitting doom;/ The close observer can espy/A noble soul, and lineage high."</p>
